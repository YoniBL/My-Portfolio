About Me

I'm a Computer Science student from Tel Aviv, graduating from Tel Aviv University.
I love math and details, enjoying theoretical fields like Cryptography and Machine Learning.
Besides that, I also enjoy web developing, taking online classes and practicing frontend and backend developing.
I'm passionate, nerdy and love to study. I spent the last year as a researcher at TAU's Neuroscience department, expanding my knowledge at other fields.

Intro to clustering- Machine learning is the biggest thing in the world right now and for a right reason. 
This project is an implementation of couple of clustering algorithms, with a small analysis that's comparing them
